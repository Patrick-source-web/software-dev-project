                <h1>About</h1>
                <p> Patrick’s Fresh Fruits was born out of a simple observation: many people had to wait for the weekly
                    market
                    days—sometimes up to three days—just to buy fruits.</p>
                <p>We noticed that even when they bought more fruits to last until the next market day, those fruits
                    often
                    didn't stay fresh or ran out too soon.</p>
                <p>That’s why we created an online fruit shop that connects buyers directly with fruit sellers in their
                    area.</p>
                <p>Whether you need your favorite fruit urgently or just want the freshest option available, we make
                    sure
                    you get it—without waiting for market day.</p>
                <p>We serve customers who value freshness, speed, and convenience. Our platform is entirely online, and
                    wedon’t just connect you with the nearest seller—we also help get the fruit to your doorstep
                    quickly,
                    thanks to our delivery service.</p>
